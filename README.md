## 5: Tell recipients how to opt out of receiving future email from you

Hello,

I'd like to no longer receive emails from *insert group here*, however your email does not contain a way for me to unsubscribe.

With that in mind, I'd like to respectfully direct your attention to the CAN-SPAM act that the US FTC passed. (https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) Specifically, I'd like you to see part 5 of the requirements, listed as, "Your message must include a clear and conspicuous explanation of how the recipient can opt out of getting email from you in the future. [It must be crafted] in a way that’s easy for an ordinary person to recognize, read, and understand." You are currently in violation of the CAN-SPAM, and I would like to be taken off your email list.

Thank you,
*Your name*

## 6: Honor opt-out requests promptly

Hello,

I'd like to no longer receive emails from *insert group here*, however your unsubscription form *requires I pay a fee* **or** *requires I give you personally identifying information* **or** *is broken* **or** *is unessicarily complex*.

With that in mind, I'd like to respectfully direct your attention to the CAN-SPAM act that the US FTC passed. (https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business) Specifically, I'd like you to see part 6 of the requirements, listed as, "You can’t charge a fee, require the recipient to give you any personally identifying information beyond an email address, or make the recipient take any step other than sending a reply email or visiting a single page on an Internet website as a condition for honoring an opt-out request." You are currently in violation of the CAN-SPAM, and I would like to be taken off your email list.

Thank you,
*Your name*
